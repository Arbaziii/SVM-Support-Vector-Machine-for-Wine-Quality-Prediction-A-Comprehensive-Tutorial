# SVM-Support-Vector-Machine-for-Wine-Quality-Prediction-A-Comprehensive-TutoRIAL

This repository provides a detailed tutorial on Support Vector Machines (SVM), focusing on how different kernels (Linear, Polynomial, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Sigmoid) impact the behavior and performance of the SVM model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explain the concept of SVM and demonstrate how the choice of kernel function affects classification results. It includes the following:

- An introduction to SVM and kernels.
- Implementation of SVM with various kernels.
- Comparison of model performance using different kernels on a sample dataset.

## Installation

To run the tutorial locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/svm-kernels-tutorial.git
